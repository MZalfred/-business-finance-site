Step-by-Step Plan:

1. Learning and Research Phase:

Understand the Financial Sector: Research the financial domain, especially business financing. Understand what businesses look for in such platforms.
Study Competitors: Analyze features and UX of thinkbusinessloans.com and others.
2. Planning and Designing:

Outline Requirements: List all functionalities and features based on your research.
Create Wireframes: Design the layout of the website. Tools like Balsamiq or Figma can be helpful.
Plan for Mobile Responsiveness: Decide on a responsive design framework like Bootstrap.
3. Technology Stack Decision:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frameworks like React or Vue.js for dynamic content).
Backend: Node.js, Python (Django or Flask), or Ruby on Rails.
Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
API Integration: Research APIs offered by potential partners/lenders.
Security: Learn about HTTPS, data encryption, secure authentication.
4. Development:

Set Up Development Environment: Use Terminal (ZSH) to set up your local development environment.
Version Control: Use Git for version control. GitHub or GitLab can host your repositories.
Start with Backend: Set up the server, database, and API endpoints.
Then Frontend: Develop the user interface based on your wireframes.
API Integration: Work on integrating external APIs.
5. Testing and Feedback:

Unit Testing: Write tests for your code.
User Testing: Get feedback on UX/UI from potential users.

Next Steps:
Create these files: Use your text editor to create index.html, style.css, and script.js in your project directory.
View Your Webpage: Open index.html in a web browser to see your initial webpage.
Version Control: Remember to commit these files to Git and push them to your GitHub repository.

Next Steps
User Authentication: Start planning for implementing user authentication.
Database Integration: Consider adding a database to store user data.
API Integration: Plan how you will integrate external APIs as needed.

Next Task
Start by enhancing the frontend with additional content and features. Parallelly, begin planning the backend logic for user authentication and form handling. If you're new to these concepts, it might be helpful to start with some tutorials or guides specifically focused on user authentication in Node.js.
